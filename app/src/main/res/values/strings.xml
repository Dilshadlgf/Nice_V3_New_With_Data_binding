    <string name="vc_message">"Pro Soil is a soil health, management and upgradation based project funded by the German government, which is being run continuously for the last five years by Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University under Madhya Pradesh, in Balaghat and Mandla districts in collaboration with MANAGE Hyderabad. Presently this project is being fully adopted by the Agricultural University. So far, more than 200,000 farmer brothers and sisters are getting the benefit of the knowledge of advanced technology by joining this project. Balaram Application is a network for climate related information and soil management. Which uses weather data, weather conditions, and soil health parameters to calculate which measures are appropriate and useful for sustainable soil management, especially for the location in question. This information PC Or can be easily accessed through tablets and smart phones. Farmers who have a suitable Android or smart phone can directly access this vital data and the resulting recommendations. Other than this, Experts are also available through the platform to provide personalized advice tailored to individual needs. Thus farmers have access to relevant knowledge and timely advice. In this way they can improve their ability to adapt to the ill effects of climate change by being able to plan and secure the crop. Soil is our life, Soil is the gift of nature, in making it healthy, it is the duty of not only farmer brothers but all human beings, for which we should first stop soil erosion. Slowly move towards natural farming using minimum chemicals. The way agricultural land is being reduced today and farmers are increasingly dependent on chemical fertilizers to get more yield. According to Indian tradition, ancestors transfer their wealth to the coming generations. Due to which their future generation is safe keeping their future and their honor and respect. does. Today, farmers are using only chemical fertilizers indiscriminately, due to which imbalance in soil nutrients is being seen in the soil. Along with the crops and the soil, the climate is also being affected. Therefore, to solve all these problems, Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University has prepared Balram Application App for the farmers of Madhya Pradesh, which will give information about when, what and how to manage the work to keep the soil healthy. I am sure that this Balram App will act like a bridge between the farmers and the university, our scientists deserve congratulations for giving a meaningful shape to this innovative effort. I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the efforts made by MANAGE Hyderabad and GIZ, the sponsor of the ProSoil project. What and how to do task management. I am sure that this Balram App will act like a bridge between the farmers and the university, our scientists deserve congratulations for giving a meaningful shape to this innovative effort. I also take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the efforts made by MANAGE Hyderabad and GIZ, the sponsor of the ProSoil project. What and how to do task management.

    <string name="vc_message_2">"Madhya Pradesh is a major producer of soybean and wheat. Sharbati variety of famous quality wheat is being grown in some districts of the state. Madhya Pradesh leads in the production of gram, linseed, green peas, garlic and coriander. It has also been a leader in mustard and lentil production. Agro-climatic diversity and topographical variations enable the state to grow a wide range of cereals, pulses, oilseeds and cash crops, Apart from this, the state is also a leader in organic production along with forest areas and collection of innumerable varieties of different species of plants. Behind all these successes are our hardworking farmer brothers and sisters, who are working day and night with full devotion and dedication, are illuminating the name of our state in the field of agriculture and in their difficult circumstances, our Jawaharlal Nehru Agricultural University's Krishi Vigyan Kendras are working. He has always been guiding through scientific and agricultural colleges, as a result of which Madhya Pradesh has been honored with Krishi Karman Award seven times for the development and expansion of new modern technology of agriculture and the honor of the best agricultural state of India. Is. Pro-Soil is a project funded by the German Government, which, along with other states of India, currently in two districts of Madhya Pradesh, Mandla and Balaghat, in collaboration with MANAGE-Hyderabad, since 2016. The university is being run successfully, the benefits of which are being fully availed by our farmers and farmers, women and entrepreneurs. Under this project, keeping in view the awareness of our farmer brothers, their needs and hard work towards agriculture, to make the farmer brothers more successful, the university is making Balaram application available under the pro-soil, this application is based on soil, climate Like gives very important information related to the pre-weather conditions. Apart from this, farmers can get information related to agriculture themselves through our experts through the nearest agriculture platform. In the coming time, the benefit of this project is likely to be started in almost all the districts of Madhya Pradesh. So that no farmer brother and sister of our state should be deprived of this facility. Considering the successful role of Balram application, it is expected to reach to more than 5 lakh farmers by the year 2024. I hope that this Balram app will prove beneficial for all the farmer brothers and sisters of our Madhya Pradesh. To make this innovation effort a success, I thank the Honorable Vice Chancellor of our University, Dr. P.K. Thank you Bisen sir. Also, I congratulate the scientists associated with this project. On this occasion, I would also like to express my gratitude to MANAGE Hyderabad and GIZ, the sponsor of the Prosil project. Thank you Bisen sir.
